Bump Version Numbers
--------------------

Before tagging, ensure the version number has been incremented to the milestone (i.e. 4.6.2) in the following places:

- pom.xml
- doc/sphinx-guides/source/conf.py
- doc/sphinx-guides/source/versions.rst 

Here's an example commit where all three files were updated at once: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/commit/99e23f96ec362ac2f524cb5cd80ca375fa13f196

Merge "develop" into "master"
-----------------------------

The "develop" branch should be merged into "master" before tagging. See also the branching strategy described in the :doc:`version-control` section.

Write Release Notes
-------------------

Create a draft release at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/new

- The "tag version" and "title" should be the number of the milestone with a "v" in front (i.e. v4.6.2).
- For the description, follow previous examples at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases

Please note that the current process involves copying and pasting a running Google doc into release notes but we are conducting an experiment whereby developers can express the need for an addition to release notes by creating a file in ``/doc/release-notes`` containing the name of the issue they're working on. Perhaps the name of the branch could be used for the filename with ".md" appended (release notes are written in Markdown) such as ``5053-apis-custom-homepage.md``. To avoid accumulating many stale files over time, when a release is cut these files should probably be removed with ``git rm``. This experiment may help inform a future experiment having to do with improvements to our process for writing SQL upgrade scripts. See the :doc:`sql-upgrade-scripts` section for more on this topic.

Make Artifacts Available for Download
-------------------------------------

Upload the following artifacts to the draft release you created:

- war file (``mvn package`` from Jenkins)
- installer (``cd scripts/installer && make``)
- database migration script (see also the :doc:`sql-upgrade-scripts` section)
- other files as needed, such as an updated Solr schema
